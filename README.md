### Why use KuberLogic?

The ultimate goal of KuberLogic is to provide an easily accessible service to turn any containerized application into a cloud-native SaaS solution.

KuberLogic:

- Provides a straightforward and reliable way to deploy and manage application instances (Tenants) while achieving maximum resource utilization and standardization;
- Simplify migration to multi-tenancy using industry-standard containers & K8s and allows rapid migration to SaaS with minimal application modification;
- Gives independence and frees from vendor lock, as KuberLogic is open source and based on Kubernetes to provide a consistent platform anywhere

### Requirements

Kubernetes cluster 1.20-1.23
