KuberLogic is an open-source solution that helps to deliver any single-tenant application (one stack per customer) to multiple users as-a-cloud service. KuberLogic allows software vendors to accelerate their journey to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with minimal modifications to the application.

### Installation

### Features

- Application instance (Tenant) orchestration (list/provision/delete)
- Custom domain (subdomain) support
- Application (Tenant) isolation
- RESTful API and CLI for service management (bare minimum)
- SSL support

### Coming soon

- Integration with billing provider (Chargebee)
- Scheduled and Instant backups (Velero)
- Application instance updates

### Why use KuberLogic?

The ultimate goal of KuberLogic is to provide an easily accessible service to turn any containerized application into a cloud-native SaaS solution.

KuberLogic:

- Provides a straightforward and reliable way to deploy and manage application instances (Tenants) while achieving maximum resource utilization and standardization;
- Simplify migration to multi-tenancy using industry-standard containers & K8s and allows rapid migration to SaaS with minimal application modification;
- Gives independence and frees from vendor lock, as KuberLogic is open source and based on Kubernetes to provide a consistent platform anywhere

### Requirements

Kubernetes cluster 1.20-1.23

- StorageClass configured as a default
- IngressClass configured as a default
