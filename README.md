----

KuberLogic is a powerful way to deliver your application as-a-service.

KuberLogic is an open-source platform that helps to deliver any single-tenant application (one stack per customer) to multiple users as-a-service. It allows software vendors to accelerate their journey to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

----

## Features
* Tenant and application instance orchestration
* Automatic minor updates
* Automatic failover
* Scheduled backups
* REST API for service management

## Requirements
KuberLogic leverages a lot of top notch open-source projects and it requires a specific environment to run on top of:
* Kubernetes cluster with:
  * 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 versions are supported
  * StorageClass configured as a default
  * LoadBalancer Services
  * At least 2 nodes in cluster with 4G of RAM, 2 CPUs and 5G of disk space each
  * Minikube or Kind installations with docker driver installations are not supported due to performance penalties.
* S3 compatible storage for backups (optional)

## Installation

1. Download `kuberlogic-installer` command-line installation tool for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kuberlogic/kuberlogic/releases) and add it to PATH.
2. Prepare the KuberLogic [configuration file](modules/installer/README.md#Configuration).
3. Run `kuberlogic-installer install all -c <configFile>`
4. Run `kuberlogic-installer status -c <configFile>`
5. Add DNS records for KuberLogic endpoints so they are pointing to KuberLogic Ingress IP. Alternatively, if you are evaluating KuberLogic, you may want to use /etc/hosts file to provide the access locally.

## Usage
### REST API
KuberLogic supports RESTful API for service management. To learn more visit:
* [API Scheme](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuberlogic/kuberlogic/master/modules/apiserver/openapi.yaml)


## Build KuberLogic
KuberLogic artifacts are container images and the installer binary. Requirements are:
* Golang 1.16
* Helm CLI 3.x
* Docker
### Build container images
`make docker-build docker-push`
### Build the installer
`make installer-build`
### Tests
KuberLogic includes a set of integration tests. They can be run in two modes:
* Local mode when KuberLogic operator & apiserver are started as goroutines:
* Remote mode when tests send API requests to a remote apiserver.

To run tests in both modes, dependencies must be installed into a Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
kuberlogic-installer install all
# setup Minio for backup & restore tests
cd modules/apiserver
make deploy-minio create-bucket
```
For more information see [docs](modules/apiserver/tests/README.md).

#### Local mode
```shell
cd modules/apiserver
make undeploy-operator generate-local-webhook-certs patch-endpoint
MY_VERSION=5.7.31 GODEBUG: x509ignoreCN=0 KUBERLOGIC_KUBECONFIGPATH=${HOME}/.kube/config make coverage-report RUN=/mysql 
```

#### Remote mode
```shell
cd modules/apiserver
MY_VERSION=5.7.31 GODEBUG: x509ignoreCN=0 KUBERLOGIC_KUBECONFIGPATH=${HOME}/.kube/config make remote-test REMOTE_HOST=<apiserver endpoint> RUN=/mysql
```
